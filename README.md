# machine-to-cloud-connectivity-framework
Machine to Cloud Connectivity Framework V1 will help manufacturing customers improve visibility into their factory operations by allowing them to securely connect their factory equipment to AWS cloud. This solution expands the portfolio of industrial protocols that AWS supports out of the box, thus allowing customers to store, analyze and act on the data from factory equipment in the cloud and use this information to drive an increase in plant efficiency and uptime, improve production flexibility and identify new business opportunities.
